## [1.0.0] - 2025-01
### Changed
- **Major refactoring of Edge class architecture:**
  - Removed `EdgeCastingType` dependency and related casting logic
  - Simplified Edge class by removing complex discriminant handling
  - Renamed fields for clarity:
    - `source_discriminant` → `match_source`
    - `target_discriminant` → `match_target`
    - `source_relation_field` → `relation_field`
    - `target_relation_field` → removed (unified into single `relation_field`)
  - Removed `non_exclusive` field and related logic
  - Simplified weight configuration by removing `source_fields` and `target_fields`
  - Edge casting type is now determined automatically based on match fields

- **Actor system improvements:**
  - Added `LocationIndex` parameter to all actor `__call__` methods
  - Removed `discriminant` parameter from `VertexActor` constructor
  - Enhanced actor initialization with better type hints and validation
  - Improved vertex merging with `merge_doc_basis_closest_preceding`

- **Core architecture changes:**
  - Replaced `EdgeCastingType.PAIR_LIKE`/`PRODUCT_LIKE` with simplified logic
  - Added `VertexRep` class for better vertex representation
  - Enhanced `ABCFields` with `keep_vertex_name` option
  - Improved type annotations using `TypeAlias`

- **Dependency updates:**
  - Updated numpy from 2.2.5 to 2.3.2
  - Updated pandas from 2.2.3 to 2.3.2
  - Updated networkx from 3.4.2 to 3.5
  - Updated pytest from 8.3.5 to 8.4.1
  - Updated python-arango from 8.1.6 to 8.2.2
  - Added pandas-stubs 2.3.0.250703 for better type support
  - Added tabulate 0.9.0 for table formatting
  - Added types-pytz 2025.2.0.20250809 for type annotations

### Removed
- `EdgeCastingType` enum and related casting logic
- Complex discriminant handling in Edge class
- `source_collection` and `target_collection` fields (now private)
- `non_exclusive` field from Edge class
- `source_fields` and `target_fields` from WeightConfig
- `_reset_edges()` method from EdgeConfig

### Added
- `LocationIndex` type for better location handling
- `VertexRep` class for vertex representation
- `keep_vertex_name` option in ABCFields
- Enhanced type annotations throughout the codebase
- Better error handling and validation

## [0.14.0] - 2025-05
### Changes
- Refactored Tree-like and table-like resources to `Resource`, using actors. All schema configs must be adopted.

## [0.13.14] - 2024-08
    `manange_dbs` script accepts parameters parameters `--db-host`, `--db-password` and `--db-user` (defaults to `root`).  

## [0.13.6] - 2024-02

## [0.13.5] - 2024-01

## [0.13.0] - 2023-12

### Changed
- In `Vertex`
  - `index` and `extra_index` are joined into `indexes`
- In VertexConfig
  - `collections` became `vertices`
  - `blanks` became `blank_vertices`
  - it now contains `list[Vertex]` not `dict`
  - each `Vertex` contains field `name` that was previously the key
- In `EdgeConfig`
  - `main` became `edges`
  - `extra` became `extra_edges`
- In `MapperNode` 
  - edge is now defined under `edge` attribute of `MapperNode` instead of being a union with it
  - `maps` key becomes `children`
  - `type`: `dict` becomes `type`: `vertex`

     - create_database
     - delete_database
     - define_vertex_indices
     - define_edge_indices
     - delete_collections
     - init_db
     - upsert_docs_batch
     - insert_edges_batch
