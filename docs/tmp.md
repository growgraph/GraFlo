## Best Practices

1. **Schema Design**
   - Keep vertex and edge types meaningful and consistent
   - Use appropriate property types for your data
   - Consider indexing frequently queried properties

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Use batch processing for large datasets
   - Enable parallel processing when possible
   - Monitor memory usage during transformation

3. **Data Quality**
   - Implement data validation in your schema
   - Use filters to clean and transform data
   - Handle missing or invalid data appropriately
