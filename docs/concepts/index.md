# Concepts

Here we introduce the main concepts of GraphCast.

## Basic Concepts

- Class `Schema` encapsulates a set of rules required to cast data sources to graph databases.
- `Resources` - a set of mappings and transformations of a data source to vertices and edges.
- `Vertex Configuration` - definitions of vertices and their database indexes. 
- `Edge Configuration` - definitions of vertices and their database indexes.
